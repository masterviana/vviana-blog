Hello everyone,

This is my first blog post, first of all thanks for reading my blog, today i'll discuss a topic that i think is useful for many developers specially for those who are new in server configuration or system administrator. Here's the problem :

Imagine if have a simple website (like personal website or a blog) and you want to make this public through the web, the normal way of doing this is buy a VPS service (virtual private server) in any provider (ovh, godaddy).
